## How to

You create grounds using the + button at the bottom left.

After that you set the name, notes and general ratio in the middle panel.

With that all set, you only need the right panel, which will show you how much coffee
you need for an amount of coffee, with slider to make it weaker or stronger depending on how
you want it.
